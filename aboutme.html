<h1 class="myheader">Ivan Munn</h1>
<img src="ME_IMG.png">
<p class="writing">Ivan was born September 28, 2007, in Berkeley, California. He has five sisters, Milla, Lillia, Brooklyn, Chelse, Waverly, and one brother named Boris, three dogs, Rosie, Teddy, and Hershey. Ivan's mother, Vera, is a first-generation American after her grandfather Ivan and his immediate family fled Ukraine to escape the nazis during world war 2. After fleeing Ukraine, they eventually ended up in Wisconsin until they moved to Chicago, where my mother was raised. Ivan sadly passed away when Vera was 13, but 27 years later, Vera would name her second son after Ivan. in the 14 years following, Ivan would grow up to play badminton, soccer, and skateboarding in his free time. On November 27, 2021, Ivan fractured his arm in 3 places, leading him into the surgery room on December 8, 2021, where a titanium rod would be placed inside his arm. While Ivan was still recovering, he had been focusing on one of the only sports that he could play with his injury, badminton. Ivan has been playing for the PHS badminton team for the past two months. Ivan hopes to get the titanium rod removed from his arm and be able to use his arm normally again.
